This directory contains the code used for the MCS report, in particular to
compare different centroiding algorithms. 
It includes code to

- run centroiding for data sets with different setups
  (basically an offline version of the MCS code, without the database)
- run SeXtractor on the same data (PSF fitting and windowed parameters)
- calculate various diagnostics from the above
    - spot size, brightness
    - frame to variation in position
- plot individual examples of the diagnostics
- compare different methods individuall or over the whole set

The subdirectory Simulations contains routines to generate simulated
images, using the output of PSFEx and information from the images.
