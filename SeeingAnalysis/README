This directory contains various diagnostic plots used to analyse
engineering data from the MCS commissioning runs. In particular, it incluces

- seeing tests
- maps and histograms of
    - spot motion RMS,
    - spot size and brightness
- plot by time of
    - fitted transformations (scaling, etc)
    - mean spot size/brightness

- overall summaries of the run with plots by time of
   - telescope parametesr
   - RMS
   - spot size

The code should be fairly easily used for similar plots with real PFI
images, rather than just the pinhole mask.
